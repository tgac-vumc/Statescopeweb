## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

Statescope can operate on a variety of systems depending on the data size:

- **Small-scale data**: Suitable for Binder (1 CPU, 2GB RAM on Google Cloud).
- **Large-scale data**: Performance improves significantly with higher computational power. Our recommendation for optimal performance is:
  - **CPU**: 40 threads (Xeon 2.60GHz or equivalent)
  - **Memory**: 128 GB RAM

Statescope‚Äôs Empirical Bayes procedure includes independent optimization steps that can be parallelized to leverage multiple CPUs for faster execution.

> **Note**: For faster performance, the Statescope deconvolution module has GPU support, which can make computations 3-4 times faster.

### OS Requirements

Statescope is primarily tested on Linux-based operating systems. We recommend:
- **Linux distributions**: CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 16.04.
  
> **Note**: While BLADE might work on other OS platforms (macOS, Windows with WSL), these setups may require additional configurations.

## üõ†Ô∏èAdditional Information

#### Installing Conda

If you don‚Äôt already have Conda installed, you can download and install Miniconda by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Download the appropriate installer for your OS.
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system to set up Conda.

After installation, you can verify Conda by running:

```bash
conda --version
```
